  <h2>Oh, the THINKS You Can Think!</h2>
  <h4><a href="https://archive.org/stream/ohthinksyoucanth00seus#page/n1/mode/2up">by Dr. Seuss</a></h4>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Nobody, <strong>NOBODY</strong>, can think up the <strong>THINKS</strong> that DR. Seuss thinks.</p>
  <p>This is a book <em>Beginning Readers</em> will love because...</p>
  <p>They'll find that the sentences are short and easy to read...</p>
<p>And the rhymes are catchy and funny...</p>
<p>And they'll be able to recognize <strong>MOST</strong> of the words...</p>
<p>And the words they <strong>DON'T</strong> recognize are the kind of wonderful silly nonsensical words that only Dr. Seuss can think up.</p>
<p>It's the kind of book that children will love to read - and think about - all by themselves.</p>
